Person 1:
  Freddy sophmore computer science major
  My goal is to organize my time in college to finish my degree by the end of my 4th year.
  My barrier is not being able to realize and organize what courses I need to take in order to complete my goal.


Person 2:
  Jack: Freshman undecided, considering computer science.
  Main Goal: Wants to learn more about the computer science course path, how it would affect his schedule, how many credits he would have to take a semester, etc.
  Main Barrier: Advisor hasn't been much help, doesn't really know the comp sci coursework, so he needs a reliable source that can tell him about course requirements, 
    credit requirements, and how to organize his schedule
