Person 1:
  Freddy sophmore computer science major
  My goal is to organize my time in college to finish my degree by the end of my 4th year.
  My barrier is not being able to realize and organize what courses I need to take in order to complete my goal.


Person 2:
  Jack: Freshman undecided, considering computer science.
  Main Goal: Wants to learn more about the computer science course path, how it would affect his schedule, how many credits he would have to take a semester, etc.
  Main Barrier: Advisor hasn't been much help, doesn't really know the comp sci coursework, so he needs a reliable source that can tell him about course requirements, 
    credit requirements, and how to organize his schedule

Person 3:
  Tommy: Sophomore Chemical Engineering Major, planning on double majoring with computer science 
  Main Goal: Has already completed CISC106, and various breadth and college requirements per Chem E curriculum, will need to know if he can fit the major in 12 credits per semester at most to allow at least 9 credits for his CHEG classes.
  Main Barrier: Computer science prerequisties are hard to follow, not sure how his degree requirements would be affected if he had to reduce the course load one semester.
